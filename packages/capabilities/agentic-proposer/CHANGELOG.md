# Changelog — ugence-agentic-proposer

## 0.0.1 — unreleased (S0 skeleton)

A version is declared only because the MVP readiness artifact
(`docs/architecture/ADR_UGENCE_AGENTIC_PROPOSER_MVP_READINESS.md`) exists and
records owner decisions D1–D5. No public contract is frozen at this version and no
public-API snapshot is created or asserted.

### Added

* Package skeleton following the `agent-workforce-composer` convention: setuptools
  build with a dynamic version from `version.py`, `py.typed`, `conftest.py` for bare
  source checkouts, and an isolated-wheel distribution verifier.
* The ratified D4 vocabulary and nothing else: `TerminalOutcome`,
  `CandidateDisposition`, `SemanticAuditorFindingStatus`, and the
  `RESERVED_AUTHORITY_VOCABULARY` prohibition set.
* `tests/test_boundaries.py` — static import scan of every source file plus an
  isolated-subprocess probe of what the public API actually loads, against the
  forbidden legacy frameworks, authority-owning capabilities, envelope/identity
  reference stacks, control planes, and network/model SDKs.
* `tests/test_vocabulary.py` — equality assertions on each ratified enum, the
  reserved-term prohibition, the INDETERMINATE positional split, the
  ABSTAIN-is-not-a-denial guarantee, and a scan rejecting any ALLOW/DENY/DEFER triad
  or confidence-to-outcome gate.
* `tests/test_no_local_canonicalization.py` — proves the package defines no local
  JSON-canonicalization or digest function anywhere, imports no hashing module, and
  declares `ugence-jcs` as the only identity substrate.

### Not implemented

The eight canonical contracts, the eligibility and readiness equations, proposal
identity, invoice-domain checks, reason codes, read-only adapters, model-assisted
extraction, the semantic auditor, and any HTTP endpoint. None is authorized at S0.
