# Changelog — ugence-agentic-proposer

## 0.0.1 — unreleased (S0 skeleton; S1 enforcement guards)

A version is declared only because the MVP readiness artifact
(`docs/architecture/ADR_UGENCE_AGENTIC_PROPOSER_MVP_READINESS.md`) exists and
records owner decisions D1–D5. No public contract is frozen at this version and no
public-API snapshot is created or asserted.

### Added

* Package skeleton following the `agent-workforce-composer` convention: setuptools
  build with a dynamic version from `version.py`, `py.typed`, `conftest.py` for bare
  source checkouts, and an isolated-wheel distribution verifier.
* The ratified D4 vocabulary and nothing else: `TerminalOutcome`,
  `CandidateDisposition`, `SemanticAuditorFindingStatus`, and the
  `RESERVED_AUTHORITY_VOCABULARY` prohibition set.
* `tests/test_boundaries.py` — static import scan of every source file plus an
  isolated-subprocess probe of what the public API actually loads, against the
  forbidden legacy frameworks, authority-owning capabilities, envelope/identity
  reference stacks, control planes, and network/model SDKs.
* `tests/test_vocabulary.py` — equality assertions on each ratified enum, the
  reserved-term prohibition, the INDETERMINATE positional split, the
  ABSTAIN-is-not-a-denial guarantee, and a scan rejecting any ALLOW/DENY/DEFER triad
  or confidence-to-outcome gate.
* `tests/test_no_local_canonicalization.py` — proves the package defines no local
  JSON-canonicalization or digest function anywhere, imports no hashing module, and
  declares `ugence-jcs` as the only identity substrate.

### Added — S1 enforcement obligations (D6, D7, D8)

The three `[R]` obligations the readiness ADR carries for S1, each enforced by a test
that holds before the surface it governs exists and arms itself when that surface
lands. See `docs/S1_ENFORCEMENT.md`.

* `tests/test_no_auditor_status_projection.py` — D6's standing rule. Rejects the five
  source shapes a status-into-outcome projection takes, and is parametrized over
  every outcome- or disposition-typed field the package defines, so it binds with the
  first such field.
* `tests/test_advisory_contract_shape.py` — D7. Bars the `Proposal*` and
  `Recommendation*` name prefixes, bars any unratified `ugence.agentic_proposer.*`
  kind string, requires identity to be computed only by a call into `ugence_jcs`, and
  rejects the eight barred fields at any nesting depth, statically and (when the
  types exist) over the live models.
* `tests/test_role_projection_bounds.py` — D8. Discovers every shared contract
  distribution in the repository and asserts none carries, snapshots or depends on
  the role projection; asserts the projection exists in no other package; and rejects
  every role lifecycle verb across this package's defined and imported surface.
* `tests/test_no_local_canonicalization.py` — extended to pin the three modules above
  by name and to assert that every file in `src` and `tests` is either scanned or one
  of the two named exemptions.

### Not implemented

The eight canonical contracts, Equations 1–3, proposal identity, invoice-domain
checks, reason codes, read-only adapters, model-assisted extraction, the semantic
auditor, and any HTTP endpoint.

The contracts and equations are not merely unauthorized now: nothing in this
repository defines them. They were not inferred, derived or invented, so
`ProposerAdvisory` and `CandidateAdvisory` are not defined either — D7 ratifies their
names and exclusions but not their field sets. The D7 guard is complete and dormant
instead. No public-API snapshot is created: there is no S1 contract surface to freeze,
and the version stays `0.0.1`.
